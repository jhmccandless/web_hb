2. standard on/off
   One timer that count downs once
3. on off but repeated
   like gregs

4. circuits
   not an on/off, but more of a next exercise
   need x amount of exercies
   rest optional
   need x time per exercies
   need x time for rest

app needs:

- different timers

  main time hightlight
  sounds for countdowns
  when timers get low
  colors
  repeater minor times
  add the ones missing
  organize better
- deployment
- timer pause button
- warning if leaving timer page if timer is started
- fill out about page
- create submenu from menu for different workouts
- better routing
  maybe have /workout*{WORKOUT TYPE} or /form*{FORM TYPE}

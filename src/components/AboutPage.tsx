          Say goodbye to scrambling to chalk up before you start your first hang
          and to getting your phone chalked up as well. And Say hello to a
          better hangboarding experience. Welcome to the Hangboarding
          Application!
        </p>

        <p>
          This application is designed for the climbers to have a hands off hang
          boarding experience. With repeaters having a mini set within the
          exercise itself, it is hard to ensure one is starting and stopping
          when they should as well as potentially having to handling the phone
          when you need to start another timer for resting between the exercise
          sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Hangboarding Application, you can set the repeaters to your
          desired time specifications, press start, and follow along handsfree.
          Enjoy and be on the lookout for updates soon! RLL
